                <p> Capsule hotels are a great choice for an economic, and comfortable stay!</p><br>

                <p> While traveling across multiple regions of Japan, capsule hotels could provide one with the much needed hospitality to just stay the night.
                    Hotel Zen and many other hotels alike provide guests with lockers to store their personal items, bath amenities to allow guests to freshen up,
                    as well as a single bed tightly enclosed by a room (capsule) for guests to sleep in.</p> <br>

                <p> Capsule hotels could be found everywhere in the cities, and travelers could fall back to it when the need for a temporary stay arises. For example, it might be a good idea to stay at a capsule hotel in between flights/transit in Japan. </p>

                <p> Staying in Ryokans had been the traditional way for visitors to find a place to sleep. The first of such inns was established in 705 A.D.</p> <br>

                <p> Ryokans often provide traditional Japanese cuisine to their patrons. In addition, guests are housed in rooms with tatami flooring, and are given traditional Japanese clothing (yukata) during their stay.</p> <br>

                <p>The costs for staying at Ryokans nowadays varies greatly due to its scarcity in metropolitan areas. You are more likely to find affordable ones in rural areas in Kyoto.</p>
